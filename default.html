            <p>
                I want to tell you many things, about how much I love you and fear losing you.
                I apologize if I've been a bother to you with all my antics. But I hope you know,
                I always strive for the best for you. This relationship often has its ups and downs, its ebbs and flows.
                But whatever happens, I want us to still have each other. You're the best thing that has ever happened
                to me.
                I will do my best here also in work and I will take care of myself and you should too!!
                <br><br>
                Let's never tire of fixing things together, because I don't want to be with anyone else but you.
                If something is missing, let's complete it together. If something is wrong, let's find the truth together, as a pair.
                <br><br>
                With you, I've learned that life is about being grateful and feeling content.
                If we keep seeking perfection, we'll lose the person who's always there for us.
                I don't want to learn to love someone else; allow me to keep loving you, over and over again.
                I believe we can complement each other.
                <br><br>
                Let's make our dreams come true together. I love you always, and I will always cherish you.
                You have fun in Japan okay? I will wait for you.
                <br><br>
                I love you so much! I'll miss you!
